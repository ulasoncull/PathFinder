# PathFinder
The project that solves a given maze in four different ways and apply path algorithms.
The project prints the following requierements:

• Adjacency Lists of Each Vertex of the Graph After Maze to Graph Operation
• Adjacency Matrix of the Graph After Maze to Graph Operation
• The number of edges found
• BFS output between the starting and the end points of the maze
• The number of visited vertices for BFS
• DFS output between the starting and the end points of the maze
• The number of visited vertices for DFS
• Shortest path between the starting and the end points of the maze
• The number of visited vertices for Shortest Path
• The cheapest path for the Weighted Graph
• The number of visited vertices for the Weighted Graph
• The cost of the cheapest path
